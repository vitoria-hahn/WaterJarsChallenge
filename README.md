# WaterJarsChallenge
This is a project for my Algorithms and Data Structure Class.

You are advising the sheik of a distant emirate, who wants you to resolve a
problem that has plagued his family for generations: according to legend, an ancestor of the sheikh reebeu
from a genie three jugs of water and he had to move the water from one to the other until reaching quantities
established by genius. This was not always possible, and therefore the sheikh is plagued by doubts.
Now the problem has been passed on to you, and you must do what you can, always respecting the
original rules of the problem:
1. It is forbidden to throw water away.
2. It is forbidden to take water from a source.
3. You can only empty one jug into another or fill the other jug ​​up to the brim.
Of course you don't want to spend your day playing with jars and would rather write a program that
solve the problem. For this, your program must read the input data below:
Abilities c1, c2 and c3 of the three jars given by the genie. (These apaities will be of no.
maximum 40 liters ada).
The quantities of water a1, a2 and a3 contained in the three jugs given by the genie.
The desired amounts of water t1, t2 and t3 in the three jugs at the end of the movements.
Your program must read the data and determine the fewest possible moves to leave
the water divided in the desired way.
